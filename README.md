# ===========================MOBILE PAYMENT PLATFORM===============================


There are two ideas we are considering:
1. A mobile payment that allows the transfer of money from one currency to another currency.
2. A DEMO Bank that does only debit and credit.

# USE CASE 1: A mobile payment that does the transfer of money from one currency to another currency rides can be summarized as followed....
User Authentication ==> deposit/withdraw money (credit/debit) ==> conversion of the money to the currency you want to transfer the money to (the rates changes daily) ==> transaction initiated to the beneficiary's account ==> transaction completed and beneficiary receives payment.

# USE CASE 2: A DEMO bank that does only debit and credit can be summarized as follows........
User Authentication ==> money mapped to user's account ==> user's initiate transaction to another user on the database ==> completes transaction ==> beneficiary confirms the payment.

Below is a pictoral flow for NUMBER 2
